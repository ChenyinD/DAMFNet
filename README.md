# DAMFNet
A dual attention guided multi-scale fusion network (DAMFNet) to effectively extract global and local information, improving the detection of small-scale changes and edges
## DAMFNet
The pytorch implementation for **MSCANet** in paper "[Change Detection Guided by Dual Attention Mechanism: A New Strategy for Integrating Global and Local Information]"

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- Pytorch 2.2.1
- numpy 1.2
